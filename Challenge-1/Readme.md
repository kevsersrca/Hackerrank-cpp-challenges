#### Objective 
In this challenge, we're practicing reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.
<hr>
In C++, you can read a single whitespace-separated token of input using cin, and print output to stdout using cout. For example, let's say we declare the following variables:

```asm
string s;
int n;
```

and we want to use cin to read the input "High 5" from stdin. We can do this with the following code:

```asm
cin >> s >> n;
```
The above code reads the first word ("High") from stdin and saves it as string , then reads the second word ("") from stdin and saves it as integer . If we want to print these values to stdout, we write the following code:

```asm
cout << s << " " << n << endl;
```
The above code prints the contents of string , which is the word "High". Then it prints a single space (), followed by the contents of integer . Because we also want to ensure that nothing else is printed on this line, we end our line of output with a newline via endl. This results in the following output:
```
High 5
```
#### Task 
Read  numbers from stdin and print their sum to stdout.

`Note`: If you plan on completing this challenge in C instead of C++, you'll need to use format specifiers with printf and scanf.

#### Input Format
A single line containing  space-separated integers: , , and .

####Constraints
```asm
1<= a,b,c <=1000
```
#### Output Format
Print the sum of the three numbers on a single line.
Sample Input
```asm
1 2 7
```
Sample Output
```asm
10
```

Explanation
The sum of the three numbers is 1+2+7=10
