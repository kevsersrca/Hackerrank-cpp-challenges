An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

#### Declaration:
```asm
int arr[10]; //Declares an array named arr of size 10, i.e; you can store 10 integers.
```

Accessing elements of an array:
```asm
Indexing in arrays starts from 0.So the first element is stored at arr[0],the second element at arr[1]...arr[9]

```
You'll be given an array of  integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

#### Input Format
The first line of the input contains ,where  is the number of integers.The next line contains  integers separated by a space.

#### Output Format
Print the  integers of the array in the reverse order in a single line separated by a space.
